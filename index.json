What neural processes enable such transfer of information across brains during naturalistic teaching and learning? Here, we show that during lectures, wherein information transmission is unidirectional and flows from the teacher to the student, the student‚Äôs brain mirrors the teacher‚Äôs brain and that this neural coupling is correlated with learning outcomes. A teacher was scanned in fMRI giving an oral lecture with slides on a scientific topic followed by a review lecture. Students were then scanned watching either the intact lecture and review (textitN = 20) or a temporally scrambled version of the lecture (textitN = 20). Using intersubject correlation (ISC), we observed widespread teacher-student neural coupling spanning sensory cortex and language regions along the superior temporal sulcus as well as higher-level regions including posterior medial cortex (PMC), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Teacher-student alignment in higher-level areas was not observed when learning was disrupted by temporally scrambling the lecture. Moreover, teacher-student coupling in PMC was significantly correlated with learning outcomes: the more closely the student‚Äôs brain mirrored the teacher‚Äôs brain, the more the student improved between behavioral pre-learning and post-learning assessments. Together, these results suggest that the alignment of neural responses between teacher and students may underlie effective communication of complex information across brains in classroom settings.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterSignificance statementtextless/h3textgreater textlessptextgreaterHow is technical, non-narrative information communicated from one brain to another during teaching and learning?

Despite major advances in measuring human brain activity during and after educational experiences, it is unclear how learners internalize new content, especially in real-life and online settings. In this work, we introduce a neural measure for predicting and assessing learning outcomes. Our approach hinges on the idea that successful learning involves forming the ‚Äúright‚Äù set of neural representations, which are captured in ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù activity patterns shared across individuals. Specifically, we hypothesized that understanding is mirrored in ‚Äúneural alignment‚Äù: the degree to which an individual learner‚Äôs neural representations match those of experts, as well as those of other learners. We tested this hypothesis in a longitudinal functional MRI study that regularly scanned college students enrolled in an introduction to computer science course. We additionally scanned graduate student ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in computer science. We found that alignment among students successfully predicted overall performance in a final exam. Furthermore, within individual students, concepts that evoked better alignment with the experts and with their fellow students were better understood, revealing neural patterns associated with understanding specific concepts.

In previous human intracranial (iEEG) work (Golan et al., 2016) we found that excitatory broadband high-frequency activity transients, driven by eye blinks, are suppressed in higher-level but not early visual cortex. Here, we utilized the broad anatomical coverage of iEEG recordings in 12 eye-tracked neurosurgical patients to test whether a similar stabilizing mechanism operates following small saccades. We compared saccades (1.3¬∞‚àí3.7¬∞) initiated during inspection of large individual visual objects with similarly-sized external stimulus displacements. Early visual cortex sites responded with positive transients to both conditions. In contrast, in both dorsal and ventral higher-level sites the response to saccades (but not to external displacements) was suppressed. These findings indicate that early visual cortex is highly unstable compared to higher-level visual regions which apparently constitute the main target of stabilizing extra-retinal oculomotor influences.","tags":null,"title":"Increasing suppression of saccade-related transients along the human visual hierarchy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"   The brain getting bored   What happens when the brain gets bored?

However, the precise nature of the changes in cortical activity during short-term training of under an hour is still not fully understood. In this study, we have examined the effects of such short training in a visual recognition task on cortical activity using functional imaging (BOLD fMRI). Participants performed a gender/age discrimination task on face images for 28min, preceded and followed by resting state scans. Our results reveal a consistent and progressive signal reduction during stimuli presentation compared to a fixation baseline, which was reflected in participant's subjective experience as evaluated by post-scan questionnaires. The BOLD reduction surprisingly included both task-positive and task-negative regions. While higher order face-selective regions showed a reduced positive peak response, negatively-responding areas ‚Äì including the peripheral visual representations as well as the Default Mode Network ‚Äì showed deeper negative BOLD responses during the visual stimulation periods. Interestingly, these training effects have left significant traces in the spontaneous resting-state fluctuations following the training period in areas that partially correspond to those that showed response changes during task performance.

We examined the neural correlates of this perceptual distinction using intracranially measured ECoG signals from the human visual cortex in 14 patients. In early visual areas (V1 and V2), the disappearance of the stimulus due to either invisible blinks or salient blank video frames ('gaps') led to a similar drop in activity level, followed by a positive overshoot beyond baseline, triggered by stimulus reappearance. Ascending the visual hierarchy, the reappearance-related overshoot gradually subsided for blinks but not for gaps. By contrast, the disappearance-related drop did not follow the perceptual distinction ‚Äì it was actually slightly more pronounced for blinks than for gaps.

Brain imaging studies have repeatedly demonstrated functional selectivity in entire cortical areas and networks using predetermined stimuli. However, it is not clear to what extent these networks are heterogeneous, i.e., whether the selectivity profiles in subregions within each sensory network show significant dissimilarity. Here, we studied local functional selectivity in the human cortex using naturalistic movie clips shown to 12 patients implanted with intracranial electrocorticography electrodes (590 in total), providing extensive cortical coverage. We examined the similarity of response profiles (40- to 80-Hz gamma-power modulations) across electrodes using a novel data driven approach without assuming any predefined category. Our results show that the functional selectivity of each highly responsive electrode was different from that of all other electrodes across the sensory cortex. Thus most responsive electrodes showed an activation profile that was unique in each patient and was similar to that of only 0.3% (1-2) of all other electrodes across all patients. Functional similarity between electrodes was linked to anatomical proximity. While in most electrodes the source of selectivity was complex, a small subset showed the well-documented selectivity to faces and actions. Our results indicate that the human sensory cortex is organized as a mosaic of functionally unique subregions in which each site manifests its own special response profile.","tags":null,"title":"Selectivity of audiovisual ECoG responses revealed under naturalistic stimuli in the human cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meir Meshulam","Eyal Winter","Gershon Ben-Shakhar","Itzhak Aharon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"dabcb67cea357dfded167090871e30f5","permalink":"https://me-sh.github.io/publication/meshulam-rational-2012/","publishdate":"2020-06-19T16:24:05.358385Z","relpermalink":"/publication/meshulam-rational-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We present here the concept of rational emotions: Emotions may be directly controlled and utilized in a conscious, analytic fashion, enabling an individual to size up a situation, to determine that a certain ‚Äúmental state‚Äù is strategically advantageous and adjust accordingly.
